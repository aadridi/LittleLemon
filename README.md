URLs/API paths you can test :

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/restaurant/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/restaurant/menu/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/restaurant/booking/tables/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/1

CAREFUL ! My tests are inside each app's tests.py file. You basically just have to type "python manage.py test" ONCE and it will run all the tests located in each tests.py file regardless of the app.
